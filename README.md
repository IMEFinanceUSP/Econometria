## Contributing

In order to contribute to this repository, you must create a new branch with your code, setup a pull-request with your changes and have your code reviewed by pairs. First, pull the
main changes into your local repository, by running

```bash
$ git pull
```

Then, to create a new branch, run

```bash
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

As you make changes to the app, do some commits that expressively describe what you have changed, by running

```bash
$ git commit -m "<your-message>"
```

The -m flag set a message to your commit, e.g. "Update header component with app logo". It is strongly recommended that your messages have imperative verbal mode. If you need to
push your changes into a upstream branch, you must run

```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

or, if you already set the branch to upstream, just run

```bash
$ git push
```

After finishing the changes, create a pull-request in the main repository GitHub page or in your branch page and request a pair review of your code to merge it.
